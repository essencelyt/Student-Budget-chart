This program will help a student to stay within a monthly budget. First, ask the user for the monthly expense goal. Next, ask the user for the amount spend on rent, utilities, transportation, and food. Assume an additional fixed expense of a car payment of $325.75 that should be set up as a variable. As shown below, report in a neat chart with each item, its amount and percentage.

Under the chart, report the goal, the total expenses, and the amount leftover. Precision should be set to two decimal places. The chart should use field width (not multiple blanks) to neatly align columns. The chart should include your name (replace ‘Student’ with your name) in the chart heading and should use blank lines as shown to separate content. 

You should test your program on several data sets. Use the data set below for the final run to submit. Take a screenshot and submit both your source code(.py) and screenshot as explained.
